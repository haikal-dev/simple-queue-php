I'm trying to achieve simple queue management (paperless) when people waiting for their queue in certain area like banking area.

## TO DO (For development)

- Implement DB.
- Implement a form for creating a new line and generate QR code.
- Implement an application form for queue in selected line.
- Implement admin (authorized line) to call people and remove the queue.
- Implement QR Code for people to scan the line.
